# Creating-a-README.md
This document will demonstrate how to create a README.md in GitHub.
## What is a README file?
A README is a text file that introduces and explains a project to other developers. Creating a concise and legible README is a critical component for the success of a project. However, to create a README successfully, it is important to understand how to use Markdown.
## What is Markdown?

Markdown is a language used to write files using formatted text. It could also be described as a simplified version of HTML. To understand Markdown, check out this [markdown cheatsheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) or the basic writing and formatting syntax documentation provided by [Github Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).

## Create a Repository 
Before beginning your README, you must create an account on GitHub. Do so now before proceeding to the next steps. Once you've created your account, you can add a new repository by either clicking the green icon labeled "**New**" located next to Top Repositories on the left side of the page or by navigating to the center of the page and clicking "**Create a new repository**."

**Important**: Your repo name *must* be the same as your username. Select "**Public**", so that other developers can contribute to your project. Then, click "**Add a README file**" in the appropriate checkbox, like the screenshot shows below.

To **edit**, click the **Pencil icon** on the right side of the README.md file. This will bring you to the editor view. You also have a Preview tab in order to see the formatting of the file.

## Adding headers in Markdown
Now, I will explain basic formatting of a README.md file. This should include headers, bulleted lists, hyperlinks, and images for ease of use. Begin by replacing your username with your title. Use hashtags to specify headers and their size. The more hashtags you insert, the smaller the header. You can use #,##,###, and so on to specify your layout. Your introduction should look something like this if done correctly:

## Adding bulleted lists in Markdown
Bulleted lists should be used to help organize subpoints and other information in your README.md file. To create a list, add a dash (-). Then, leave a space between the dash and the following character. In the screenshot below, I will be adding a bulleted list to my "About me" header. Like so:

## Adding hyperlinks in Markdown
Adding hyperlinks allows contributors to access outside information sources that can provide clairty to the project without cluttering the README.md file.  The proper syntax to add links in Markdown is:

## Adding emojis in Markdown
Adding emojis is a great way to impart a more casual or fun tone. Refer to this list of [emoji shortcodes](https://github.com/ikatyang/emoji-cheat-sheet/blob/master/README.md) to add emojis to your document. :grin:  

## Final result
Here is what your README.md file should look like so far:

Here is what it looks like when viewed in the **Preview** tab:

If you are happy with your results, scroll-down to the bottom of the page until you see the "**Commit changes**" icon. You can also add details in the description box to inform other contributors what changes were made in the document. If you do not add any details, GitHub will automatically add the title "Update README.md," but it is best practice to always add your own updates to edits for future projects. When you have finished adding a description, **click** the green button. Your README file will now show publicly in your GitHub Profile.

You are now ready to personalize your own README.MD file! :clap:
